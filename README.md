# HeavyTailedQCPs
A Java project that randomly generates and solves (using backtrack random search procedures) specialized Latin Square problems that correspond to an algorithm developed by Alda Carvalho (2010).

Not all of the source files are used in the final generation/solve procedure. However, I uploaded them here in order to display some of the interesting attempts to speed up the procedure.
